# oai-client

The goal for this project is to learn or improve upon the following:

- Improve myself in Rust
- Understand web services in the Rust world
- Learn async Rust
- Learn Leptos

## Steps

- [x] Write my "Hello World" in Leptos
- [ ] Send AI queries to the backend that will be handled by `rig`, and respond appropriately
- [ ] For fun and jankiness, add a Llama-based backend, with its respective page, and have it stream text responses back
      to the front end. Llama can be...shitty...but it's kinda funny to see how long it'll ramble, and `kolosm` allows
      for direct writing to a stream. Learning.

## Note!

None of this will look like amazing Rust. I'm very new to this, coming from Go and C/C++, so don't expect highly
idiomatic or optimized code.
